= RapidIO Subsystem Guide

[[intro]]

== Introduction


	RapidIO is a high speed switched fabric interconnect with
	features aimed at the embedded market.  RapidIO provides
	support for memory-mapped I/O as well as message-based
	transactions over the switched fabric network. RapidIO has
	a standardized discovery mechanism not unlike the PCI bus
	standard that allows simple detection of devices in a
	network.
  


  	This documentation is provided for developers intending
	to support RapidIO on new architectures, write new drivers,
	or to understand the subsystem internals.

[[Limitations]]

=== Limitations


	    
. Access/management of RapidIO memory regions is not supported


. Multiple host enumeration is not supported


	 

[[drivers]]

== RapidIO driver interface


		Drivers are provided a set of calls in order
		to interface with the subsystem to gather info
		on devices, request/map memory region resources,
		and manage mailboxes/doorbells.

This archive contains the following scripts:
	asciidoc-convertor -> used to extract the comments from a .c file
			  the asciidoc-convertor script is a modified version of the kernel-doc script and it is used the same way,
			  the output is different , coresponding to the asciidoc format for manpages and pdf.
	
	function-extractor -> used to extrat all the names of the functions/struct/typedef/enum form the input file/files

	run_asciidoc -> is the script that combines the first two and creates the manpage or pdf according to the input file/files or options "-man / -pdf"
			it  calls asciidoc-convertor with the function parameter and then concatenates the result into a manpage
			named by the user.
			The result from running "run_asciidoc" are all the individual manpage for all the structured comments in the files
			and the combined version of the manpage.
			Also running the script will produce ".doc " files that are the product
			of running asciidoc-convertor, these files are deleted but can be used to 
			add or modify the content of the manpage. The format is easily understandable.
